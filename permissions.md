When executing the serverless deploy command in AWS, the following permissions are typically required:

- AWS Lambda Permissions:
- lambda:CreateFunction: Allows creating Lambda functions.
- lambda:UpdateFunctionCode: Permits updating the code of existing Lambda functions.
- lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration: Allows modifying the configuration of existing Lambda functions.
- lambda:AddPermission: Enables adding permissions to Lambda functions, such as invoking them from other services.
- Amazon API Gateway Permissions:
- apigateway:CREATE_REST_API: Allows creating a new REST API.
- apigateway:PUT_METHOD: Permits creating or updating methods for a REST API.
- apigateway:PUT_INTEGRATION: Enables creating or updating integrations for a REST API.
- apigateway:CREATE_DEPLOYMENT: Allows creating a new deployment for a REST API.
- AWS IAM Permissions:
- iam:CreateRole: Allows creating IAM roles.
- iam:PassRole: Permits passing an IAM role to AWS services during deployment.
- CloudFormation Permissions:
- cloudformation:CreateStack: Allows creating a new CloudFormation stack.
- cloudformation:UpdateStack: Permits updating an existing CloudFormation stack.
- cloudformation:DescribeStacks: Enables describing the details of existing CloudFormation stacks.
- These are some of the common permissions required for deploying a serverless application using the Serverless Framework. Depending on your specific application and the services used, additional permissions may be necessary. It's recommended to follow the principle of least privilege and grant only the required permissions to the execution role associated with your deployment process.
